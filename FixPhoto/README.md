# Fix Photo #

This is a quick utility for "fixing" images that have been captured by mobile phones, for 3D reconstruction. The goal of this utility is to perform the following operations:

* Remove distortion within the system.
* Reformat the calibration parameters.
* Crop and resize images.
* Change the image naming convention.
* Make sure that all the images are orientated correctly.
