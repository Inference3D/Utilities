# NVM Extractor #

The role of this utility is to extract the poses out of a VisualSFM NVM file. It is hoped that shortly the role of VisualSFM will be replaced with a machine learning-based bundle adjustment approach - however, it is the state-of-the-art tool that I am using for the moment to estimate poses from a free-moving mobile phone camera.
